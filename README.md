# A copy of Amazon's store page, cart, and delivery system.
Made without the use of a backend, framework, or database.

This project emphasized more on the JavaScript side, as most of the HTML and CSS was already done, it was just put together.

It used a *custom* database (made inside the project) to get the info for the products.
